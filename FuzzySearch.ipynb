The idea behind n-gram matching is searching for similar words, but not necessarily exact matches. One of the simplest ways of calculating similarity between two words is calculating the longest common sequence (LCS) of letters. The longer the LCS is the more similar the words are. However, this approach has one big disadvantage – absence of context. For example, words `connection` and `fonetica` have a long LCS (o-n-e-t-i) but very different meanings. To add some context, ngram sequences are used.\n",

To get rid of length differences we normalize the LCS length by word length. We calculate these matches to get a rating with a value between 0 (no match at all) and 1(fully matched). \n",
