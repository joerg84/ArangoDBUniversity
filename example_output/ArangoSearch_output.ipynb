Each View represents an inverted index to provide fast full-text searching over one or multiple linked collections and holds the configuration for the search capabilities, such as the attributes to index. It can cover multiple or even all attributes of the documents in the linked collections. Search results can be sorted by their similarity ranking to return the best matches first using popular scoring algorithms.\n",
